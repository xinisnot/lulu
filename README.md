## lulu

lulu is MIDI-controlled live granular. It is also released on [Gumroad](https://xinisnot.gumroad.com/l/lulu). If you like it, I would appreciate if you can leave a small tip.

This repository has C++ codes that RNBO generates in `export` directory. If you want to modify original RNBO patches or export as different codes such as JavaScript, you must purchase RNBO licenses.
